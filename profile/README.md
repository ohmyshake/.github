# Welcome to Oh-My-Shake Organization ðŸ‘‹

We focuse on solving challenging problems relevant to environmental and energy systems using the tools of applied geophysics and HPC resources.

A central theme is using seismology to solve generational problems at the interface between human activity and the subsurface, mainly CO2 mitigation and energy production in a carbon-constrained world, management of scarce water resources, and understanding the impact of climate change on subsurface systems including permafrost stability and the weathering cycle.
